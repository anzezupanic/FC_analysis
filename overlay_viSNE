% overlay_viSNE.m
% 
% overlay cells that were not used in construction of a viSNE map 
% (but with the same number of parameters), with the
% viSNE map, based on similarity. For each cell, similarity with all cells
% in the viSNE map is calculated (based on all 12 parameters), and the
% location if the most similar cell is chosen. 
%

% from viSNE mat session you load two datasets:
%   SNE - dataset, with each particle of the viSNE map represented by a row 
%    and the two SNE component values given in the two columns
%   Sample - dataset, with each particle of the viSNE map represented by a
%    row, and the 12 flow cytometry measurements represented 

% scatterplot of the viSNE map
scatter(SNE(:,1), SNE(:,2),'.')
hold on

% load the data from the cells you want to overlay:
%   forOverlay - each particle is in a row, while the 12 flow cytometry measurements
%       are in the columns. We advise that you do not use many more than
%       3000 cells due to long calculations times. 

% calculate the closest cell from Sample

distancematrix = zeros(size(forOverlay,1),size(Sample,1));
for ii = 1: size(forOverlay,1)
    for jj = 1:size(Sample,1)
        distancematrix(ii,jj)=norm(forOverlay(ii,:)-Sample(jj,:));
    end   
end
% find the best match for each of 3000 singleSpec datapoints
[mini, tempindex] = min(distancematrix');
% find the SNE coordinates for all those points
coordinates = zeros(size(forOverlay,1),2);
for ii = 1:size(forOverlay,1)
    coordinates(ii,:) = SNE(tempindex(ii),:);
end
% plot the points on the viSNE map
scatter(coordinates(:,1), coordinates(:,2), 50,'r', 'filled' )
